    <h1>Kyana Hay</h1>
    <p>I aspire to achieve financial freedom through a combination of academic success, professional growth, and entrepreneurship. My first goal is to master this course and graduate with a degree in Statistics and a certificate in Business Analytics. I plan to apply for and secure an internship where I can put my theoretical knowledge into practice and gain hands-on experience. Iâ€™m eager to enter the workforce, starting with any opportunity that allows me to grow and begin climbing the corporate ladder. In addition to my academic and career goals, I also run a nail business where I offer manicures and nail enhancements. I hope to continue developing my entrepreneurial skills and expand my business as part of my long-term vision for success.</p>
